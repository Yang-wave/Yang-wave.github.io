## Exterior structure

In the external structure part, we use MAtlab to establish a mathematical model and calculate the center of gravity, metacenter, center of buoyancy and center of drift of the buoy

When calculating the center of gravity, we install a weight directly below the buoy, and the center of gravity of the weight is s meters away from the buoy. We assume that the buoy as a whole is an ellipsoid, and the center of the ellipsoid is the coordinate origin

## Dynamo
We mainly consulted the literature and looked up the principle of the generator

## Sensor
In terms of sensors, we have learned about some core parts, such as Arduino Nano development board and microcontroller
• Adafruit anemometer sensor
• 0.96 inch I2C OLED display
• MT3608 boost converter module
• 3.7V lithium-ion battery
• Intelligent: buzzer, in addition to the sensor circuit

## In addition, we made a Gantt chart of our schedule based on school curriculum requirements
