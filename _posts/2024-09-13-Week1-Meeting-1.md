This note demonstrates some of what [Markdown][1] is capable of doing.

## An exhibit of Markdown




## URLs

URLs can be made in a handful of ways:

* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.
* Another named link to [MarkItDown](https://www.markitdown.net/)
* Sometimes you just want a URL like <https://www.markitdown.net/>.


## Finally

There's actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.
