## Main Point  

In the third week, our group made new progress. In terms of external structure design and hydrodynamic simulation, we have initially designed the external structure, and in terms of sensor design, we have initially designed the external structure and internal circuit of the sensor





## External structural design and hydrodynamic simulation

In the last week, Yin Muyang drew several sketches according to the information he consulted, mainly divided into the buoy type and the floating ball type.

However, in this week's study, it was found that the design of the float buoy is easy to be asymmetric, and the asymmetric buoy is easy to be stressed unevenly, resulting in overturning in the sea. Therefore, in consideration of the stability of the buoy, we decided to use the float type, so the following structures are retained

Later, after consulting the data of the sea area near Dalian, it was found that although the usual wave height in Dalian was less than two meters, in 2019, Typhoon Lekima reached Dalian, making the wave height in the sea area near Dalian reach more than 10 meters. According to the calculation formula between wave height and energy, the energy of such waves is equivalent to the equivalent of the water release of a small hydropower station. Therefore, the buoy of a single column structure is easily disintegrated under such waves, so I decided to change the single column structure to a multi-body frame structure, which can be more stable.
